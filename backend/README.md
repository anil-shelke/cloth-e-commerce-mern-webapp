A library of string validators and sanitizers.

Strings only
This library validates and sanitizes strings only.

If you're not sure if your input is a string, coerce it using input + ''. Passing anything other than a string will result in an error.

Installation and Usage
Server-side usage
Install the library with npm install validator

No ES6
var validator = require('validator');

validator.isEmail('foo@bar.com'); //=> true
ES6
import validator from 'validator';
Or, import only a subset of the library:

import isEmail from 'validator/lib/isEmail';
Tree-shakeable ES imports
import isEmail from 'validator/es/lib/isEmail';
Client-side usage
The library can be loaded either as a standalone script, or through an AMD-compatible loader

<script type="text/javascript" src="validator.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  validator.isEmail('foo@bar.com'); //=> true
</script>
The library can also be installed through bower

$ bower install validator-js
CDN

<script src="https://unpkg.com/validator@latest/validator.min.js"></script>





% -------  JWT, or JSON Web Token
%  ------- 6:10:05

JWT, or JSON Web Token, is a compact, URL-safe way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

Structure of a JWT
A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.):

Header
Payload
Signature
A JWT might look like this:

Copy code
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywiZXhwIjoxNjAwOTk5OTk5fQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
1. Header
The header contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the algorithm used to generate the signature.

json
Copy code
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
2. Payload
The payload contains the claims, which are the data you want to transmit. Common claims include user information (like user ID), roles, and expiration times.

Example payload:

json
Copy code
{
  "userId": 123,
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1600999999
}
3. Signature
The signature is created by taking the encoded header and payload, and signing it with a secret (or private) key. The secret key is known only to the server, which makes it possible to verify the token's integrity.

Signature:

scss
Copy code
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
JWT Authentication Process
Login: The user logs in, and the server creates a JWT with their user ID and sends it to the client.
Client Stores JWT: The client stores this token (in local storage, a cookie, etc.).
Client Requests with JWT: For future requests, the client sends the token to the server (often in the Authorization header as a Bearer token).
Token Verification: The server verifies the token’s signature and, if valid, grants access to the requested resources.


var jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
var token = jwt.sign({ foo: 'bar' }, 'shhhhh');
Synchronous Sign with RSA SHA256

// sign with RSA SHA256
var privateKey = fs.readFileSync('private.key');
var token = jwt.sign({ foo: 'bar' }, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' });
Sign asynchronously

jwt.sign({ foo: 'bar' }, privateKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' }, function(err, token) {
  console.log(token);
});




% ------- Multer ---------
% ------ 6:31:45 ---------

Your code sets up multer, a middleware used for handling file uploads in Node.js. This version is configured to save files locally to the file system, with a few specific settings.

Explanation of Each Part
Importing multer and path:

javascript
Copy code
import multer from "multer";
import path from "path";
multer: Middleware for handling file uploads.
path: A built-in Node.js module for working with file and directory paths, which helps set a consistent path to store uploaded files.
Storage Configuration (diskStorage):

javascript
Copy code
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function (req, file, callback) {
        callback(null, path.join(__dirname, "uploads")); // specify destination folder
    },
    filename: function (req, file, callback) {
        callback(null, file.originalname); // save file with its original name
    }
});
diskStorage: Allows you to specify where files should be saved on the disk and how they should be named.
destination: This function decides the directory where files will be saved. In this example:
__dirname represents the current directory where the script is running.
"uploads" is a folder within that directory where uploaded files will be stored.
callback(null, path.join(__dirname, "uploads")); tells multer to save files in the uploads directory.
filename: This function sets the filename for the saved files.
file.originalname uses the original filename of the uploaded file.
Note: If __dirname isn’t available (in an ES module setup), you can redefine it using:

javascript
Copy code
const __dirname = path.dirname(new URL(import.meta.url).pathname);
Creating an Upload Instance:

javascript
Copy code
const upload = multer({ storage });
This creates an upload middleware using the configured storage. You can then use upload to handle file uploads in routes.
Exporting the upload Middleware:

javascript
Copy code
export default upload;
This lets you import upload into other parts of your project and use it to handle file uploads in specific routes.
Usage in Routes
Here’s an example of how to use upload in a route to handle file uploads:

javascript
Copy code
import upload from './path-to-upload-file.js';

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
   res.send("File uploaded successfully!");
});
This setup will:

Save the uploaded file to the uploads folder.
Store it with its original filename.





% difference between  cartData[itemId][size]  and  cartData.itemId.size

In JavaScript, cartData[itemId][size] is different from cartData.itemId.size because of the way dot notation and bracket notation work:

Bracket Notation (cartData[itemId][size]):

When using cartData[itemId][size], itemId and size are treated as dynamic variables, allowing you to use their values as keys within cartData.
This is essential when you don't know the exact key names in advance, or if they are stored in variables.
Dot Notation (cartData.itemId.size):

In cartData.itemId.size, both itemId and size are treated as literal property names rather than dynamic variables.
This would only work if cartData had an actual property named itemId containing another property named size, which is not the case here.
In your example, since itemId and size are variables, you need to use bracket notation:

javascript
Copy code
if (cartData[itemId]) {
    if (cartData[itemId][size]) {
        cartData[itemId][size] += 1;
    } else {
        cartData[itemId][size] = 1;
    }
}
Using cartData.itemId.size would not reference the itemId and size variables, but rather properties with those exact names, which is likely not what you want.
